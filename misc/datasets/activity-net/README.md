## Pretrained Experts

This folder contains a collection of features, extracted from the ActivityNet [2] and ActivityNet-captions [3] datasets as part of the paper:
*Use what you have: Video retrieval using representations from collaborative experts*.

### Training splits

The training splits were taken from [3] and are given in the files linked below:

* [train_list.txt](train_list.txt) (10009 videos)
* [val_1_list.txt](val_1_list.txt) (4917 videos)
* [val_2_list.txt](val_2_list.txt) (4885 videos)

In our work, we use the `train` split for training and the `val_1` split for evaluation (the `val_1` split forms a superset of the `val_2` split, with differing captions).


**Tar contents**

The compressed tar file (TODO GiB) can be downloaded from:

```

sha1sum: TODO
```
A list of the contents of the tar file are given in [tar_include.txt](tar_include.txt).
