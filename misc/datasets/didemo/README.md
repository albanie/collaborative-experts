## Pretrained Experts

This folder contains a collection of features, extracted from the DiDeMo [2] dataset as part of the paper:
*Use what you have: Video retrieval using representations from collaborative experts*.

### Training splits

The training splits were taken from [2] and are given in the files linked below:

* [train_list.txt](train_list.txt) (8392 videos)
* [val_list.txt](val_list.txt) (1065 videos)
* [test_list.txt](test_list.txt) (1004 videos)

NOTE: That in the original paper [2], the training split contained 8395 videos (three are missing in our split).
